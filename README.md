Sispack is a simple shell scripted program, that gives the output of used space in your Linux system.

For now, this is only for debian or debian-forked.

After downloading the package,
  Make it executable: chmod +x sispack

take it to local bin directory. ie. ~/.local/bin

Now it's done! run it anywhere.
